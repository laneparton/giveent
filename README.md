### Give Entmod
One of the first AMX Mod X Half-Life scripts I mashed together when I was 11 years old (lol) - putting it on GitHub to preserve the memory :)

Release: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=47095 *Disclaimer: I was 11... :D*

Context: This was an admin script, specifically built for Sven Co-Op (a Half-life mod), that saved users to a file and gave them access to an old mod called Entmod (basically Garry's Mod before it was built).
